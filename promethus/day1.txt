1. run the prometheus using docker-compose up . 
why docker-compose. 
prometheus needs configuration files for scrapping and inventory . 
all the configuration files are passed as volumes in docker-compose file. 

2. main part of prometheus is prometheus.yml configuration file. 

in this file , we add prometheus global configuration such as 
    scrape interval , evaluation interval . 

next we add the scrape_config 

each scrape_config is defined as jobs . we can pass list of jobs. 

3. start the prometheus container using docker compose up. 

4. navigate the port and see console. 




docker to docker communication by its ip address. 

1. run the ubuntu container - 172.17.0.3 - docker run -d ubuntu sleep infinity

2. run the prometheus container - 172.17.0.1

3. run the nginx container - 172.17.0.2

4. exec to ubuntu container , ping other containers using their ip address and it works.
